  Can you write a robot that finishes the delivery task faster than goalOrientedRobot?
  If you observe that robotâ€™s behavior, what obviously stupid things does it do?
  How could those be improved?

  koeida says: Well, it isn't picking the next destination based on which one has
  the shortest route. That's a quick fix.

  A more complex fix might be trying out all possible combinations of routes and seeing
  which requires the shortest total steps.

  Lets do the first fix.
